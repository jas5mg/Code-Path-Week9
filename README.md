# Code-Path-Week9

1) For this assignment, I deployed the dionaea honeypot.

2) Originally I had an issue where I was unable to access the Admin VM website. I was unable to get this verison of the VM to behave correctly, so I deleted the VM and had to restart the installation process.

3) I collected over 60,000 different attacks on the VM. These attacks used three differnt types of protocols mssqld, SipSession and pcap. The majority of the attacks came from Russia, China, and the United States.

4) Out of the 60,000 attacks, how many of the attacks were committed by an individual? A large percent of the attacks are probably run automatically by computers that automatically target insecure addresses, but I assume some of them were maunally performed as well.
